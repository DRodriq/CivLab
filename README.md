## CivLab
CivLab is an ABM framework inspired by sugarscape-style models and turn-based civilization style games. This framework aims to create a visually pleasing simulation on top of an extensible agent logic and a highly modular environment. 

The goal is for anyone to be able to checkout this repo and get started watching their own artificial societies grow, and to experiment with custom rule sets, environment properties, and data collection.

Assets (and much inspiration!) are taken from ben-ryder's Conqueror of Empires project located here https://github.com/ben-ryder/Conqueror-of-Empires
